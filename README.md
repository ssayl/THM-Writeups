# THM-Writeups
A collection of my THM write-ups and solutions.

## Overview

Welcome! This repository is a personal knowledge base where I document my approach, thought process, and solutions for various TryHackMe challenges. Whether youâ€™re a beginner looking for tips or an intermediate learner wanting to cross-check solutions, feel free to explore.

## Repository Structure

I organize each write-up in its own folder (or file), typically named after the specific TryHackMe room.

Each folder may include:
- **writeup.md** (the main walkthrough or solution)
- **screenshots/** (any relevant images used in the write-up)
- **additional artifacts** (like scripts, text files, or logs)

## Disclaimer

1. These write-ups are for **educational purposes** only.  
2. They represent my **personal approach** to solving each challenge and are not official solutions.  
3. **No warranty** is provided; some methods may differ from how others solve the same rooms.

**Happy hacking!**  
Feel free to reach out with questions, suggestions, or just to say hello.
